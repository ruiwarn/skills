# Embedded Code Review Expert

## Overview

Perform structured review of embedded and firmware changes with emphasis on memory safety, interrupt correctness, RTOS usage, hardware interfaces, C/C++ pitfalls, and embedded security.

The preferred review strategy is **cross-review by two independent subagents** that inspect the same diff separately, then compare findings for consensus, gaps, and contradictions.

The purpose of running two subagents is **to improve correctness, not speed**. Cross-review exists to reduce false positives, reduce false negatives, and increase confidence that a reported issue is real before escalating it to the user.

The skill is intentionally **host-agnostic**:
- Do not hardcode Claude Code, Codex, ACP, or any vendor-specific runtime.
- Use the current environment's native parallel subagent mechanism when available.
- If the environment supports model selection, use **two different high-capability models** for the two subagents.
- If model selection is unavailable, still run two independent subagents with different review emphases.
- If parallel subagents are unavailable, fall back to a single-agent review and state that cross-review could not be run in this environment.

Target environments: bare-metal MCU, RTOS (FreeRTOS/Zephyr/ThreadX), Linux embedded, mixed C/C++ firmware.

## Trigger

Activate when the user asks to review embedded or firmware code changes. Examples:
- "review firmware-pro2 的改动"
- "review the NFC changes"
- `/embedded-cross-review ~/Documents/dec/firmware-pro2`
- `/embedded-cross-review ~/Documents/dec/firmware-pro2 HEAD~5..HEAD`
- `/embedded-cross-review <github-pr-url>`

## Severity Levels

| Level | Name | Description | Action |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Critical | Memory corruption, interrupt safety violation, security vulnerability, brick risk | Must block merge |
| **P1** | High | Race condition, resource leak, undefined behavior, RTOS misuse | Should fix before merge |
| **P2** | Medium | Code smell, portability issue, missing error handling, suboptimal pattern | Fix or create follow-up |
| **P3** | Low | Style, naming, documentation, minor suggestion | Optional improvement |

## Workflow

### Mode Selection

**Single-agent mode**:
- Use for small diffs (default threshold: ≤100 lines)
- Use when the user explicitly asks for a quick review
- Use when the host environment does not support parallel subagents

**Cross-review mode**:
- Default for diffs >100 lines
- Prefer for new features, architecture changes, and critical paths (ISR, DMA, crypto, NFC, boot)
- Implement as two independent subagents reviewing the same payload in parallel
- Primary goal: better review correctness and confidence, not faster turnaround
- If the host exposes model choice, use two different high-capability models

User can override: "用双代理 review" or "quick review 就行"

### Host Capability Rule

Choose the best available execution mode in this order:

1. Two parallel subagents with explicit different high-capability models
2. Two parallel subagents with the same model but different prompts and review focus
3. One agent review with explicit note that cross-review was unavailable

Do not abort just because a specific vendor runtime is unavailable.
Do not justify a weaker mode by claiming it is faster; the priority is review quality.

---

### Phase 0: Preflight - Scope & Context

1. Run `scripts/prepare-diff.sh <repo_path> [diff_range]` to extract:
   - Repository info (branch, last commit)
   - Target identification (MCU, RTOS, compiler)
   - Diff stat and full diff content

2. Assess scope:
   - **No changes**: Inform user; offer to review staged changes or a commit range.
   - **Small diff (≤100 lines)**: Default to single-agent review unless user requests cross-review.
   - **Large diff (>500 lines)**: Summarize by file or subsystem first, then review in batches.
   - **Critical path touched** (ISR, DMA, crypto, NFC, boot): Strongly prefer cross-review.

3. Build review context package:

```text
REVIEW_CONTEXT = {
  repo_info: (branch, MCU, RTOS, compiler),
  diff: (full git diff text),
  references: (relevant checklist sections from references/),
  focus_areas: (user-specified or auto-detected critical paths)
}
```

4. Load only the relevant reference files:
   - `references/memory-safety.md`
   - `references/interrupt-safety.md`
   - `references/hardware-interface.md`
   - `references/c-pitfalls.md`

---

### Phase 1: Single-Agent Review

For small diffs or when cross-review is not requested or not available:

1. Memory safety scan
   - Stack overflow, buffer overrun, alignment, DMA cache coherence, heap fragmentation
   - Flag `sprintf`, `strcpy`, `gets`, `strcat`; suggest bounded alternatives

2. Interrupt and concurrency correctness
   - Shared variable access, critical sections, ISR best practices, RTOS pitfalls
   - Priority inversion, reentrancy, nested interrupt handling

3. Hardware interface review
   - Peripheral init ordering, register access, timing violations, pin conflicts
   - I2C/SPI/UART/NFC buffer management and timeout handling

4. C/C++ language pitfalls
   - Undefined behavior, integer issues, compiler assumptions, linker issues
   - Preprocessor hazards, portability, type safety

5. Architecture and maintainability
   - HAL/BSP layering, abstraction, coupling, testability
   - Dead code, magic numbers, configuration management

6. Embedded security scan
   - Secret storage, debug interfaces, firmware update integrity
   - Side channels, fault injection, input validation, stack canaries

Then skip to **Phase 3: Output**.

### Phase 2: Cross-Review With Two Subagents

When cross-review mode is triggered, create two review tasks from the same `REVIEW_CONTEXT`.

#### Step 1: Define distinct review roles

Use prompts that force complementary perspectives.

**Subagent A: Embedded systems safety reviewer**

```text
You are a senior embedded systems engineer reviewing firmware code changes.

[REVIEW_CONTEXT: repo info, diff, focus areas]

Apply these review areas when relevant:
- Memory safety
- Interrupt and concurrency correctness
- Hardware interfaces and timing
- RTOS correctness
- Embedded security

Output format for each finding:
[P0/P1/P2/P3] [file:line] Title
- Description
- Risk
- Suggested fix

Flag uncertain findings with [?].
```

**Subagent B: Independent adversarial reviewer**

```text
You are an independent reviewer for embedded and firmware code.
Your job is to challenge assumptions and find correctness problems the first reviewer might miss.

[REVIEW_CONTEXT: repo info, diff, focus areas]

Focus on:
1. Logic errors and edge cases
2. C/C++ undefined behavior and integer hazards
3. Race conditions and state machine bugs
4. Hardware interface misuse, timeout paths, and recovery paths
5. Security and fault handling weaknesses

Output format for each finding:
[P0/P1/P2/P3] [file:line] Title
- Description
- Risk
- Suggested fix

Do not suppress low-severity issues. Report everything relevant.
```

If the host supports explicit model choice, assign different high-capability models to A and B. This is the preferred mode because model diversity helps validate whether a finding is genuinely problematic rather than a single-model hallucination or blind spot. If not, keep the roles different anyway.

#### Step 2: Spawn in parallel

Use the host's native subagent facility to run both tasks concurrently.

Requirements:
- Same `REVIEW_CONTEXT` for both subagents
- Independent execution
- No visibility into each other's findings before they finish
- Prefer parallel execution over sequential execution

Rationale:
- Parallelism is an implementation detail, not the objective.
- Independence matters because cross-contamination weakens validation value.
- Different strong models are preferred because the point is agreement quality, not throughput.

If the host only supports one worker model, still keep the prompts distinct.

#### Step 3: Cross-compare findings

After both complete, classify results:

1. **Consensus findings**: both subagents flagged substantially the same issue. Treat as high confidence.
2. **A-only findings**: validate and keep if technically sound.
3. **B-only findings**: validate and keep if technically sound.
4. **Contradictions**: one subagent says correct, the other says buggy. Surface this explicitly for human judgment.

Normalize all findings to unified severity levels `P0` to `P3`.

#### Step 4: Environment note

State which cross-review path was used:
- `two subagents, different high-capability models`
- `two subagents, same model with different prompts`
- `single-agent fallback`

This matters because confidence differs across modes, and the user should know whether the review outcome was cross-validated by distinct strong models or only approximated.
